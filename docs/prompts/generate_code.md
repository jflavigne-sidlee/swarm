You are tasked with generating efficient, maintainable, and modular code based on the following function definition. 
Use these key guidelines when creating the solution:

1.	Define the Problem and Context: Ensure the function fits within the broader system's purpose and functionality. 
    Clarify the problem it addresses and its context.

2.	Function-Level Goals:
    - Specify what the function should do.
    - Define the input/output format clearly.
    - Account for constraints and edge cases.

3.	Dependencies:
    - Use relevant libraries and tools as specified.
    - Follow best practices for the selected ecosystem.

4.	Modular Design:
    - Ensure the code is reusable and testable.
    - Separate logic into appropriate modules or classes.

5.	Testing Requirements:
    - Write unit tests using the pytest framework.
    - Cover normal cases, edge cases, and invalid inputs.

6.	Code Style:
    - Follow PEP 8 coding standards.
    - Include type hints, docstrings, and proper error handling.

7.	Iterative Development:
    - Implement basic functionality first.
    - Build incrementally with a focus on extensibility.

8.	Documentation:
    - Add docstrings to all functions.
    - Provide a high-level architectural overview of the system.

9.	Example Inputs and Outputs:
    - Use sample data to illustrate expected behavior.

10.	Future Extensibility:
    - Design the code to support potential enhancements.
