Please review the provided file and improve the Markdown documentation for a Python software project. Ensure the formatting is clear, structured, and adheres to best practices.

Return the improved documentation as a single Markdown code block. 

For code blocks inside the Markdown, use [[[CODE-{language}]]] to start a code block and [[[/CODE]]] to end it, where {language} is the appropriate language specifier (e.g., python, javascript, bash, etc.). 

This avoids triggering Markdown rendering while retaining language-specific syntax highlighting.

For example:

```markdown
# Example Project

## Overview
A Python-based project for demonstrating Markdown documentation.

## Installation
[[[CODE-bash]]]
pip install example-project
[[[/CODE]]]

## Usage
[[[CODE-python]]]
from example import Example
example = Example()
[[[/CODE]]]
```

Notice how the backticks are used only once in the answer. This is important to ensure that the Markdown is rendered correctly. In effect, you may only open and close the code block once in the answer.

This ensures that the language information is preserved for syntax highlighting when you replace the tags. It's clear, structured, and ready for direct copy-pasting and search-and-replace adjustments.
