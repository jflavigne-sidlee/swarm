# Best Practices for Precompiling Regex Patterns

Precompiling regex patterns is an effective way to enhance performance and maintainability in projects where regular expressions are used frequently. Below are detailed instructions and guidelines for using precompiled regex patterns in your codebase.

---

## When to Precompile Regex Patterns

### Frequent Usage
If a pattern is used repeatedly or in performance-critical paths, precompiling avoids repeated compilation overhead and improves runtime efficiency.

### Complex Patterns
For intricate regex patterns that are costly to compile, precompiling ensures they are compiled once and reused efficiently.

### Reusable Patterns
Precompile patterns shared across multiple functions or modules to maintain consistency and performance.

### Validation or Matching Loops
When regex is used in loops or over large datasets, precompilation can significantly reduce runtime overhead.

---

## When Not to Precompile

### Rare Usage
Patterns used only once or infrequently do not benefit significantly from precompilation.

### Dynamic Patterns
Regex patterns that depend on runtime inputs cannot be precompiled in advance. Instead, compile them dynamically as needed.

---

## Best Practices for Precompiling Patterns

### 1. **Group Patterns Logically**
Organize related patterns into grouped constants for better readability and maintainability.

```python
# Precompiled regex patterns for headers
HEADER_PATTERNS: Final[Dict[str, re.Pattern]] = {
    "header": re.compile(r"^(#{1,6})\\s+(.+?)$", re.MULTILINE),
    "header_with_newline": re.compile(r"^(#{1,6}\\s+.+\\n)"),
    "next_header": re.compile(r"^#{1,6}\\s+.*$"),
}
```

### 2. **Use Descriptive Names**
Clearly name constants to reflect the purpose of the regex pattern.

```python
SECTION_MARKER_REGEX: Final = re.compile(r"<!--\\s*(?:Section|SECTION):\\s*(.+?)\\s*-->")
```

### 3. **Store Patterns Where Used**
Place precompiled regex patterns near the functions or modules that use them. For shared patterns, centralize them in a common module.

### 4. **Separate Raw and Precompiled Patterns**
Keep raw regex strings separate from precompiled patterns for clarity and flexibility.

```python
# Raw patterns
RAW_HEADER_PATTERN: Final = r"^(#{1,6})\\s+(.+?)$"

# Precompiled patterns
HEADER_REGEX: Final = re.compile(RAW_HEADER_PATTERN, re.MULTILINE)
```

---

## Dynamic Patterns

For runtime-generated patterns, compile them dynamically.

```python
def compile_dynamic_pattern(base: str) -> re.Pattern:
    return re.compile(f"^{base}$")
```

---

## Performance Benefits

- **Avoid Recompilation**: Precompiling skips repetitive compilation for frequently used patterns.
- **Improved Runtime**: Particularly beneficial in loops or large-scale data processing.
- **Consistency**: Ensures patterns are standardized across the codebase.

## Example Usage

### Precompiling Regex for Markdown Parsing

```python
# Markdown regex patterns
HEADER_PATTERNS: Final = {
    "basic": re.compile(r"^(#{1,6})\\s+(.+?)$", re.MULTILINE),
    "with_newline": re.compile(r"^(#{1,6}\\s+.+\\n)"),
}
```

### Dynamically Compiling Regex

```python
def generate_pattern(prefix: str) -> re.Pattern:
    return re.compile(f"^{prefix}.*$")
```

---

## Conclusion

Precompile regex patterns when they are:
- Frequently used
- Performance-critical
- Shared across multiple components

For dynamic or rarely used patterns, runtime compilation is sufficient. Organize precompiled patterns logically to improve code clarity and maintainability.
