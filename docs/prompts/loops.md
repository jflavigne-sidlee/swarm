# How to Escape Redundant Solution Loops and Document Progress

1. **Identify the Pattern:**
- Analyze the repeated solutions. Recognize and log the key elements of the repeated output.
- Check whether the proposed solution directly addresses the failure conditions of the test.

2. **Introduce Self-Awareness:**
- Maintain an attempt log within the generated code or alongside it:
    - Annotate each solution attempt with:
        - Timestamp of generation.
        - Brief description of the approach.
        - Test cases it was designed to address.
        - Results of the tests (pass/fail and specific errors).
    - Before generating a new solution, compare it against the attempt log to avoid repetition.

3. **Reframe the Problem:**
- If stuck, rephrase the problem constraints or error conditions explicitly.
- Generate a checklist of unexplored approaches based on:
  - Alternative logic paths.
  - Different API methods, libraries, or techniques.

4. **Enhance Divergent Thinking:**
- Introduce variability in the generated solutions by:
  - Adjusting parameters (e.g., performance vs. readability).
  - Experimenting with different algorithms or methods.
  - Focusing on edge cases.

5. **Embed Diagnostic Logic in Code:**
- Include inline comments or debug logs that track each step of the new solution:

```python
# Attempt 1: Using sorting-based approach (timestamp)
# Test result: Failed on edge case with duplicate values
```

6. **Reset the Loop:**
- If all attempts fail, pause and systematically assess:
  - The assumptions underlying previous solutions.
  - Constraints or requirements not yet fully addressed.
  - Tools or frameworks not yet leveraged.

7. **Document All Findings:**
- Embed a structured documentation block into the code:

```python
"""
Solution Attempts Log:
1. Approach: Sorting-based logic
   Test Cases: [edge_case_1, edge_case_2]
   Results: Failed on edge_case_2 (reason: duplicate handling issue)
2. Approach: Hash map for fast lookup
   Test Cases: [basic_case, edge_case_2]
   Results: Passed all cases
"""
```

8. **Dynamic Feedback Loop:**
- After each solution attempt:
  - Update the attempt log.
  - Reassess unexplored strategies.
  - Avoid proposing identical solutions by cross-referencing the attempt log.

9. **Expand Context Awareness:**
- Reassess the problem by requesting additional information or examples.
- Validate your interpretation of the problem constraints and test cases.

Reminder: Your primary goal is to explore new and varied approaches for each iteration. Continuously reflect on the attempt log to prevent redundancy and ensure steady progress toward resolving the issue.
