# Coding Standards and Practices

## Overview
This document outlines the required coding practices for contributing to the Swarm Project. All code submissions must adhere to these standards to maintain code quality and consistency.

## Code Style

### Python Standards
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Maximum line length of 100 characters
- Use docstrings for all classes and functions

Example of proper function documentation:

```python
def verify_vector_store_ready(
    self, 
    vector_store_id: str, 
    max_retries: int = 10, 
    retry_delay: int = 5
) -> bool:
    """Verifies that a vector store is ready for use.
    
    Args:
        vector_store_id: ID of the vector store to verify
        max_retries: Maximum number of verification attempts
        retry_delay: Delay between retries in seconds
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if vector store is ready, False otherwise
        
    Raises:
        AssistantError: If verification fails after max retries
    """
```

### Class Structure
- Use dataclasses for configuration objects (reference: src/config.py)
- Implement proper error handling with custom exceptions
- Follow single responsibility principle

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage
- Minimum 80% test coverage required
- All new features must include corresponding tests
- Tests must be organized by category (reference: tests/functions/vision/README.md)

### Test Categories
1. Basic Functionality Tests
2. Error Handling Tests
3. Model Configuration Tests
4. Integration Tests
5. Response Validation Tests

Example test structure from:

markdown:tests/functions/vision/README.md
startLine: 233
endLine: 277

## Error Handling

### Custom Exceptions
- Create specific exception classes for different error types
- Include descriptive error messages
- Implement proper exception hierarchies

Example from:
```python:src/file_search.py
startLine: 16
endLine: 21
```

## Configuration Management

### Environment Variables
- All configuration should be manageable via environment variables
- Include validation for required variables
- Provide clear documentation for each variable

Reference the environment setup from:
```markdown:README.md
startLine: 114
endLine: 123
```

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- All public APIs must have docstrings
- Include usage examples in docstrings
- Document all parameters, return values, and exceptions

### README Requirements
- Clear project overview
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples
- Configuration guide
- Testing instructions
- Contribution guidelines

## Azure OpenAI Integration

### Client Configuration
- Use the provided AOAIClient class for Azure OpenAI interactions
- Implement proper retry logic
- Handle API version compatibility

Example from:
```python:tests/conftest.py
startLine: 31
endLine: 38
```

## File Management

### File Validation
- Implement MIME type validation
- Check file size limits
- Validate file encodings
- Handle file cleanup properly

Reference the file validation implementation from:
```python:src/file_manager.py
startLine: 30
endLine: 57
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Code Review Requirements
   - All PRs must have at least one reviewer
   - Must pass all automated tests
   - Must maintain or improve code coverage
   - Must include updated documentation

2. PR Template
   - Description of changes
   - Related issue numbers
   - Testing performed
   - Documentation updates
   - Breaking changes

3. Commit Guidelines
   - Use semantic commit messages
   - Keep commits focused and atomic
   - Include issue references

## Version Control

### Branch Naming
- feature/: For new features
- bugfix/: For bug fixes
- hotfix/: For critical fixes
- release/: For release preparations

### Commit Messages
Format:
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- feat: New feature
- fix: Bug fix
- docs: Documentation changes
- style: Formatting changes
- refactor: Code restructuring
- test: Test updates
- chore: Maintenance tasks

## Security Practices

1. Credential Management
   - Never commit API keys or secrets
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data
   - Implement proper key rotation

2. Code Security
   - Validate all inputs
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Follow security best practices for Azure OpenAI

## Performance Considerations

1. Async Operations
   - Use async/await for I/O operations
   - Implement proper connection pooling
   - Handle timeouts appropriately

2. Resource Management
   - Implement proper cleanup
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Handle rate limiting
