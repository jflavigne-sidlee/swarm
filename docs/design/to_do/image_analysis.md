# Validating and resizing large images before processing

To address the issue of validating and resizing large images before processing, you can follow these steps:

##1. Analyze Requirements

- Identify Limits:
- Define the maximum acceptable dimensions (width, height) and file size for the images.
- Ensure these limits align with the constraints of your system or API (e.g., DEFAULT_MAX_IMAGE_SIZE or a model-specific requirement).
- Preserve Quality:
- Determine whether maintaining aspect ratio is critical. In most cases, it is recommended to avoid distortion.

##2. Use a Reliable Library

- Pillow (PIL):
    - Pillow is a Python library for image manipulation. It is well-suited for resizing images.
- Alternatives:
  - If performance is critical, consider using specialized libraries like opencv-python.

##3. Implement the Resizing Logic

- Open the image using Pillow, and check its dimensions and file size.
- Resize the image if it exceeds the defined limits.
- Save the resized image to a temporary location or return it as a processed object.

##4. Integrate with Existing Workflow

- Add a resizing step during the image preparation phase (prepare_image_from_file or prepare_image_from_url).
- Ensure the resized image is passed forward for further processing.

###Code Example

Here's how you can resize images using Pillow:

```python
from PIL import Image
from pathlib import Path
import io

def resize_image(image_path: Path, max_width: int, max_height: int) -> bytes:
    """Resize an image if it exceeds the maximum dimensions.

    Args:
        image_path (Path): Path to the original image file.
        max_width (int): Maximum allowed width.
        max_height (int): Maximum allowed height.

    Returns:
        bytes: Resized image as a byte stream (if resized), or original image byte stream.
    """
    with Image.open(image_path) as img:
        # Check dimensions
        original_width, original_height = img.size
        if original_width <= max_width and original_height <= max_height:
            # No resizing needed
            with open(image_path, "rb") as file:
                return file.read()
        
        # Calculate new dimensions while maintaining aspect ratio
        img.thumbnail((max_width, max_height))
        
        # Save resized image to a byte stream
        byte_stream = io.BytesIO()
        img.save(byte_stream, format=img.format)
        return byte_stream.getvalue()
```

##5. Replace the Original Image

Integrate this function into your pipeline. For example:

```python
async def prepare_image_from_file(path: Path, max_size: int, max_width: int, max_height: int) -> InstructorImage:
    """Prepare image content from a local file."""
    # Resize image if necessary
    resized_image_data = resize_image(path, max_width, max_height)
    
    # Validate file size
    if len(resized_image_data) > max_size:
        raise ImageValidationError(f"Image exceeds max size: {max_size} bytes")
    
    # Convert resized image to base64
    base64_content = base64.b64encode(resized_image_data).decode("utf-8")
    mime_type = mimetypes.guess_type(str(path))[0]
    
    return InstructorImage(
        source=str(path),
        source_type="local_file",
        media_type=mime_type,
        data=base64_content
    )
```

##6. Optional Enhancements

- Automated Detection:
    - Add logic to detect overly large file sizes and reduce quality (compression) dynamically.
- Save Resources:
    - Store the resized image temporarily in memory or cache to avoid redundant resizing.
- Testing:
    - Test with images of various sizes, formats, and resolutions to ensure reliability and compatibility.

##7. Monitor and Improve

- Log resizing operations to identify how frequently images require resizing.
- Optimize the resizing function for your use case based on usage data (e.g., tweaking dimensions, formats, or compression levels).

By implementing this solution, you can ensure that your system handles large images efficiently while maintaining compatibility and quality.
