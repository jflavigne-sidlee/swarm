# Feature Description: search_and_replace

## Problem and Context

### Problem:
Editing large Markdown documents often involves replacing specific text patterns or phrases across the document or within particular sections. Manually searching and replacing text is error-prone and inefficient, particularly in documents with complex structures or repetitive content.

### Context:
The ```search_and_replace``` function provides a systematic way to search for and replace text across a Markdown document, ensuring accuracy and consistency. By supporting optional case sensitivity and regex patterns, it becomes a powerful tool for both simple and advanced text modifications. This feature is essential for collaborative editing, automated content updates, and document formatting tasks.

## Function-Level Goals

### Purpose:
Search for all instances of a specified text or pattern in a Markdown document and replace them with new content.

### Behavior:
- **Search Functionality:**
  - Traverse the entire document (or specified sections) to identify occurrences of ```search_text```.
  - Support optional case sensitivity and regex patterns for flexible searching.
- **Replace Functionality:**
  - Replace all matched occurrences with ```replace_text```.
  - Ensure Markdown formatting integrity is preserved.
- **Count and Output:**
  - Count the total number of replacements made.
  - Return this count as an integer to indicate the extent of changes.
- **Input/Output Format:**
  - **Input:**
    - ```file_name``` (```str```): The name of the Markdown file to modify. Must exist and be a valid ```.md``` file.
    - ```search_text``` (```str```): The text or regex pattern to search for.
    - ```replace_text``` (```str```): The text to replace the matched occurrences with.
  - **Output:**
    - Returns an ```int``` representing the number of replacements made.
  - **Example Input:**

```python
file_name = "document.md"
search_text = "Project Plan"
replace_text = "Project Overview"
```

- **Example Output:**
If the input file originally contained:

```markdown
---
title: Project Plan
author: Jane Doe
date: 2024-11-20
---
# Introduction
This document serves as the Project Plan.
```

After calling search_and_replace, the file will be updated to:

```markdown
---
title: Project Overview
author: Jane Doe
date: 2024-11-20
---
# Introduction
This document serves as the Project Overview.
```

The function would return:

```python
2  # Number of replacements made
```

### Constraints and Edge Cases:
- **File Not Found:** Raise an error if the specified file does not exist.
- **Empty Search Text:** Raise an error if search_text is empty or invalid.
- **Invalid Regex Pattern:** Raise an error if search_text is a malformed regex pattern (when regex mode is enabled).
- **Case Sensitivity:** Allow the user to toggle case sensitivity. By default, searches should be case-insensitive.
- **Preserve Markdown Integrity:** Ensure that replacing text does not break Markdown syntax (e.g., headers, links, or tables).
- **No Matches:** Return 0 if no matches are found, without modifying the file.

### Dependencies

- **Libraries:**
  - ```os``` and ```pathlib```: For file validation and handling.
  - ```re```: To support advanced regex-based searches and replacements.
  - ```logging```: To log search results, replacements, and errors.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use ```re``` for efficient and precise regex-based searching and replacing.
  - Log all replacements for traceability, especially in collaborative workflows.
  - Wrap file operations in try-except blocks to handle errors gracefully (e.g., missing files, malformed input).
  - Backup the original file before making changes to allow rollback if necessary.

## Summary of Feature

The ```search_and_replace``` function automates text replacement in Markdown documents, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and flexibility for both simple and advanced text modifications. By supporting regex patterns, case sensitivity, and robust error handling, it provides a reliable tool for collaborative editing and automated workflows, aligning with the broader goals of the Markdown Document Management System.
