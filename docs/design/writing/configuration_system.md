# Feature Description: Base Configuration System

## Problem and Context

- **Problem:**
Managing paths, settings, and default configurations across multiple modules in the Markdown Document Management System can become complex and error-prone. Hardcoding paths or settings reduces flexibility and scalability, making the system harder to maintain and test.

- **Context:**
A centralized configuration system ensures consistency, reusability, and scalability across the system. It defines core paths, settings, and validation rules for key components (e.g., metadata, file handling, Markdown processing), acting as the foundation for the entire project. By starting with configuration, we can standardize error handling, simplify testing, and facilitate future extensions.

## Function-Level Goals

- **Purpose:**
Provide a centralized configuration system for the writer module, enabling the definition and management of paths, default settings, and error handling for Markdown processing.

- **Behavior:**
  - **Configuration Dataclass:**
    - Define a structured ```dataclass``` for storing module-level configurations, including paths, file types, and default settings.
    - Support default values while allowing overrides.
  - **Path Configurations:**
    - Specify paths for:
      - Temporary files (e.g., ```data/temp/```).
      - Draft files (e.g., ```data/drafts/```).
      - Finalized files (e.g., ```data/finalized/```).
    - Ensure paths are validated and created if they do not exist.
  - **Default Settings:**
    - Define default settings for Markdown processing, such as:
      - Metadata keys (```title```, ```author```, ```date```).
      - Markdown flavors (e.g., GitHub-Flavored Markdown).
      - Encoding (e.g., ```utf-8```).
    - Allow these settings to be overridden by user-specified values during runtime.
  - **Validation and Error Handling:**
    - Validate paths and settings during initialization.
    - Provide meaningful error messages for invalid configurations.
  - **Output:**
    - Return a fully initialized configuration object.
  - **Input/Output Format:**
    - Input:
      - None for default initialization, or a dictionary of custom configurations.
    - Output:
      - A configuration object with validated paths and settings.
  - **Example Configuration Dataclass:**

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from pathlib import Path

@dataclass
class WriterConfig:
    temp_path: Path = Path("data/temp")
    drafts_path: Path = Path("data/drafts")
    finalized_path: Path = Path("data/finalized")
    default_encoding: str = "utf-8"
    metadata_keys: list = field(default_factory=lambda: ["title", "author", "date"])
```

  - **Example Initialization:**

```python
config = WriterConfig()
print(config.temp_path)  # Outputs: data/temp
print(config.metadata_keys)  # Outputs: ['title', 'author', 'date']
```

- **Constraints and Edge Cases:**
  - **Invalid Paths:** Raise an error if paths are not valid or writable.
  - **Missing Settings:** Provide fallback defaults for missing settings.
  - **Dynamic Overrides:** Ensure that user-provided configurations override defaults without affecting the base configuration.

## Dependencies

- **Libraries:**
  - **dataclasses:** To define structured and type-safe configurations.
  - **pathlib:** For robust path handling and validation.
  - **os:** For file system operations, such as creating directories if they do not exist.
  - **logging:** To log configuration initialization, warnings, or errors.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use ```dataclasses``` for clear, maintainable configuration structures.
  - Validate paths during initialization to ensure correctness and prevent runtime errors.
  - Log all configuration settings for debugging and traceability.
  - Use ```field(default_factory=...)``` for mutable defaults like lists.

## Summary of Feature

The base configuration system provides a centralized, type-safe, and flexible approach to managing paths and settings across the Markdown Document Management System. By leveraging ```dataclasses``` and ```pathlib```, it ensures robust path handling, clear defaults, and extensibility for future modules. This foundational feature simplifies testing, enhances maintainability, and standardizes error handling across the system.
