#Feature Description: save_version

## Problem and Context

### Problem:

Markdown documents often undergo multiple revisions, and there is a need to preserve previous states as versioned snapshots for reference, rollback, or auditing. Without a versioning system, maintaining a clear history of changes becomes challenging, leading to potential loss of critical content.

### Context:
The ```save_version``` function provides a mechanism to create versioned snapshots of a Markdown document. This ensures that each state of the document is preserved, enabling seamless recovery, comparison, or archiving. It is an essential feature for collaborative and iterative workflows, where tracking document changes is crucial.

## Function-Level Goals

### Purpose:
Save the current state of a Markdown document as a versioned file, ensuring a clear and traceable history of changes.

### Behavior:

- **Version Snapshot Creation:**
  - Create a new file in the same directory with an incremented version number appended to the original file name (e.g., ```file_name_v1.md```, ```file_name_v2.md```).
  - Ensure that existing versions are not overwritten.
- **Metadata Update (Optional):**
  - If version metadata is stored within the original document, update it with the new version details (e.g., version number, timestamp).
- **Output:**
  - Return the path to the versioned file.
- **Input/Output Format:**
  - **Input:**
    - ```file_name``` (```str```): The name of the Markdown file to version. Must exist and be a valid ```.md``` file.
  - **Output:**
    - Returns a ```str``` containing the path to the versioned file.
  - **Example Input:**

```python
file_name = "document.md"
```

- **Example Output:**

If the input file is:   

```markdown
---
title: Sample Document
author: Jane Doe
date: 2024-11-20
version: 1
---
# Introduction
This is the introduction section.
```

After calling ```save_version```:
- A new file, ```document_v2.md```, is created containing the same content.
- The original file may be updated (if metadata is stored within the document):

```markdown
---
title: Sample Document
author: Jane Doe
date: 2024-11-20
version: 2
---
# Introduction
This is the introduction section.
```

### Constraints and Edge Cases:

- **File Not Found:**
  - Raise an error if the specified file does not exist.
- **Invalid File Format:**
  - Raise an error if the file is not a valid Markdown file.
- **Version Conflict:**
  - Ensure new versions do not overwrite existing versioned files.
- **Metadata Integrity:**
  - Ensure any updates to metadata (e.g., version number) do not corrupt the file's structure.
- **Large Files:**
  - Handle large documents efficiently without duplicating unnecessary data in memory.

### Dependencies

- **Libraries:**
  - ```os``` and ```pathlib```: For file handling and creating versioned file names.
  - ```shutil```: For copying the original file to create a versioned snapshot.
  - ```datetime```: To timestamp the version metadata (if required).
  - ```logging```: To log versioning actions and handle potential errors.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use ```pathlib``` to construct versioned file names dynamically.
  - Log all versioning actions for traceability.
  - Maintain a consistent naming convention (e.g., appending _v# to the file name).
  - Wrap file operations in try-except blocks to handle errors gracefully (e.g., missing files, permission issues).

## Summary of Feature

The ```save_version``` function ensures that each state of a Markdown document is preserved as a versioned snapshot. By leveraging robust file handling and metadata updates, it provides a clear history of changes while preventing accidental overwrites. This feature is essential for maintaining document integrity and supporting collaborative workflows.
