# Feature Description: validate_markdown

## Problem and Context

### Problem

Markdown documents must adhere to specific syntax standards to ensure compatibility with parsers and downstream tools. Issues such as broken links, invalid tables, or malformed headers can disrupt workflows and render documents unreadable or unusable in converted formats.

### Context

The `validate_markdown` function ensures the structural and syntactical integrity of Markdown files. By detecting errors early, it prevents disruptions during editing, exporting, or publishing, making it an essential component of the Markdown Document Management System.

## Function-Level Goals

- **Purpose**:
  - Validate the Markdown document to ensure it complies with Markdown standards and is free from syntax issues.
- **Behavior**:
  - **Syntax Validation**:
    - Utilize `remark-lint` for its extensibility and comprehensive validation capabilities:
      - **Broken Links or Image References**: Use `remark-lint` with plugins to detect broken links and image references.
      - **Malformed Headers**: Use `remark-lint` to check for issues like missing spaces after `#` or incorrect nesting.
      - **Unclosed Tags**: Use `remark-lint` to identify unclosed tags for inline elements like **, _, or backticks.
    - Supplement with `markdownlint` for additional validation:
      - **Invalid Tables**: Use `markdownlint` to detect issues such as misaligned columns or missing headers in tables.
  - **Compatibility Check**:
    - Use `Pandoc` to ensure the document is compatible with various output formats, especially when finalizing documents.
  - **Error Logging**:
    - Log all detected issues with clear descriptions, including line numbers and error types.
    - Provide actionable suggestions for resolving errors.
- **Output**:
  - Return True if the document is valid.
  - Return False otherwise, along with a log of validation errors.
- **Input/Output Format**:
  - **Input**:
    - file_name (str): The name of the Markdown file to validate. Must exist and be a valid .md file.
  - **Output**:
    - Returns a bool:
      - `True` if the document is valid.
      - `False` if the document contains errors, accompanied by a detailed error log for debugging.
      
- **Example Input**:
  ```
  file_name = "document.md"
  ```
- **Example Output**:
  - For a file containing:

```markdown
# Introduction
This is a valid section.

## Table
| Name | Age
|------|---

![Image](missing_image.jpg)
```

The function would return:

```python
False
```

  - And log:
    - Invalid table at line 4: Missing table data or improperly formatted row.
    - Broken image link at line 6: File 'missing_image.jpg' not found.
- **Constraints and Edge Cases**:
  - File Not Found: Raise an error if the specified file does not exist.
  - Invalid File Format: Raise an error if the file is not a valid Markdown file.
  - Empty Files: Return False with an appropriate log if the file is empty or contains no content.
  - Markdown Flavors: Ensure compatibility with common Markdown extensions (e.g., GitHub-Flavored Markdown) if the document uses advanced syntax.

## Approach

- **Primary Validation**:
  - Use `remark-lint` for its extensibility and comprehensive validation capabilities. It can handle most of the syntax validation requirements and can be extended with custom rules.
  - Supplement with `markdownlint` for additional validation, especially if specific markdownlint rules are needed.
  
- **Compatibility Check**:
  - Use `Pandoc` to ensure documents are compatible with various output formats, especially when finalizing documents.

- **Integration**:
  - Integrate these tools into the validation workflow using `subprocess` for external tool invocation.
  - Capture and parse the output from these tools to integrate with existing logging and error handling mechanisms.

## Dependencies

- **Libraries**:
  - `os` and `pathlib`: For file validation and handling.
  - `subprocess`: To invoke `remark-lint`, `markdownlint`, and `Pandoc` as external processes.
  - `logging`: To log validation results and errors.
  - `remark-lint` and `markdownlint`: For advanced syntax validation.
  - `Pandoc`: To check compatibility with downstream format conversion.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Utilize `remark-lint` and `markdownlint` for efficient syntax validation.
  - Log all detected issues for traceability and debugging.
  - Wrap file operations and parsing in try-except blocks to handle errors gracefully (e.g., malformed input, unsupported syntax).

## Summary of Feature

The `validate_markdown` function ensures Markdown documents meet syntax standards, enabling seamless compatibility with parsers and downstream tools. By detecting and logging errors like broken links and invalid tables, it helps maintain document integrity and prevents disruptions in workflows. This feature is critical for ensuring high-quality Markdown documents in collaborative or automated environments.
