# Feature Description: validate_markdown

## Problem and Context

### Problem

Markdown documents must adhere to specific syntax standards to ensure compatibility with parsers and downstream tools. Issues such as broken links, invalid tables, or malformed headers can disrupt workflows and render documents unreadable or unusable in converted formats.

### Context

The `validate_markdown` function ensures the structural and syntactical integrity of Markdown files. By detecting errors early, it prevents disruptions during editing, exporting, or publishing, making it an essential component of the Markdown Document Management System.

## Function-Level Goals

- **Purpose**:
  - Validate the Markdown document to ensure it complies with Markdown standards and is free from syntax issues.
- **Behavior**:
  - **Syntax Validation**:
    - Utilize `mdformat` for comprehensive Python-native validation:
      - **Broken Links or Image References**: Use built-in link validation
      - **Malformed Headers**: Check for issues like missing spaces after `#` or incorrect nesting
      - **GFM Features**: Validate GitHub-Flavored Markdown features like task lists and tables
      - **Formatting Issues**: Detect inconsistent spacing, indentation, and other formatting problems
    - Custom validation for specific features:
      - **Task Lists**: Validate proper GFM task list syntax and indentation
      - **Links and Images**: Check for broken local references
  - **Compatibility Check**:
    - Use `Pandoc` to ensure the document is compatible with various output formats, especially when finalizing documents
  - **Error Logging**:
    - Log all detected issues with clear descriptions, including line numbers and error types
    - Provide actionable suggestions for resolving errors
- **Output**:
  - Return True if the document is valid
  - Return False otherwise, along with a log of validation errors
- **Input/Output Format**:
  - **Input**:
    - file_name (str): The name of the Markdown file to validate. Must exist and be a valid .md file
  - **Output**:
    - Returns a tuple (bool, List[str]):
      - bool: `True` if the document is valid, `False` otherwise
      - List[str]: List of validation errors if any
      
- **Example Input**:
  ```
  file_name = "document.md"
  ```
- **Example Output**:
  - For a file containing:

```markdown
# Introduction
This is a valid section.

## Table
| Name | Age
|------|---

![Image](missing_image.jpg)

- [ ]Empty task
-[x] Malformed task
```

The function would return:

```python
(False, [
    "Markdown formatting error: Table missing cells in row 2",
    "Broken image link: missing_image.jpg",
    "Line 10: Invalid task list marker",
    "Line 11: Incorrect task list indentation"
])
```

- **Constraints and Edge Cases**:
  - File Not Found: Raise an error if the specified file does not exist
  - Invalid File Format: Raise an error if the file is not a valid Markdown file
  - Empty Files: Return False with an appropriate log if the file is empty
  - Markdown Flavors: Support GitHub-Flavored Markdown through mdformat-gfm plugin

## Approach

- **Primary Validation**:
  - Use `mdformat` for comprehensive Python-native validation:
    - **Broken Links or Image References**: Use built-in link validation
    - **Malformed Headers**: Check for issues like missing spaces after `#` or incorrect nesting
    - **GFM Features**: Validate GitHub-Flavored Markdown features like task lists and tables
    - **Formatting Issues**: Detect inconsistent spacing, indentation, and other formatting problems
  - Custom validation for specific features:
    - **Task Lists**: Validate proper GFM task list syntax and indentation
    - **Links and Images**: Check for broken local references

- **Compatibility Check**:
  - Use `Pandoc` to ensure documents are compatible with various output formats, especially when finalizing documents

- **Error Logging**:
  - Log all detected issues with clear descriptions, including line numbers and error types
  - Provide actionable suggestions for resolving errors

## Dependencies

- **Libraries**:
  - `os` and `pathlib`: For file validation and handling.
  - `subprocess`: To invoke `remark-lint`, `markdownlint`, and `Pandoc` as external processes.
  - `logging`: To log validation results and errors.
  - `remark-lint` and `markdownlint`: For advanced syntax validation.
  - `Pandoc`: To check compatibility with downstream format conversion.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Utilize `remark-lint` and `markdownlint` for efficient syntax validation.
  - Log all detected issues for traceability and debugging.
  - Wrap file operations and parsing in try-except blocks to handle errors gracefully (e.g., malformed input, unsupported syntax).

## Summary of Feature

The `validate_markdown` function ensures Markdown documents meet syntax standards, enabling seamless compatibility with parsers and downstream tools. By detecting and logging errors like broken links and invalid tables, it helps maintain document integrity and prevents disruptions in workflows. This feature is critical for ensuring high-quality Markdown documents in collaborative or automated environments.
