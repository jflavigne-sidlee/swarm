# Feature Description: validate_markdown

## Problem and Context

### Problem:
Markdown documents need to adhere to specific syntax standards to ensure compatibility with Markdown parsers and downstream tools. Issues like broken links, invalid tables, or malformed headers can disrupt workflows and render documents unreadable or unusable in converted formats.

### Context:
The ```validate_markdown``` function ensures the structural and syntactical integrity of Markdown files. By detecting errors early, it prevents disruptions during editing, exporting, or publishing, making it an essential component of the Markdown Document Management System.

## Function-Level Goals

- **Purpose:**
Validate the Markdown document to ensure it complies with Markdown standards and is free from syntax issues.

- **Behavior:**
  - **Syntax Validation:**
    - Parse the document to detect issues such as:
      - Broken links or image references.
      - Invalid tables (e.g., misaligned columns or missing headers).
      - Malformed headers (e.g., missing spaces after # or incorrect nesting).
      - Unclosed tags for inline elements like **, _, or backticks.
  - **Use an external Markdown validator if necessary for enhanced compatibility checks.**
  - **Error Logging:**
    - Log all detected issues with clear descriptions (e.g., line numbers, error type).
    - Provide actionable suggestions for resolving errors.
  - **Output:**
    - Return ```True``` if the document is valid.
    - Return ```False``` otherwise, along with a log of validation errors.
  - **Input/Output Format:**
    - **Input:**
      - ```file_name``` (```str```): The name of the Markdown file to validate. Must exist and be a valid ```.md``` file.
    - **Output:**
      - Returns a ```bool```:
        - ```True``` if the document is valid.
        - ```False``` if the document contains errors, with a detailed error log for debugging.
  - **Example Input:**

```python
file_name = "document.md"
```

- **Example Output:**

For a file containing:

```markdown
# Introduction
This is a valid section.

## Table
| Name | Age
|------|---

![Image](missing_image.jpg)
```

The function would return:

```python
False
```

And log:

```
- Invalid table at line 4: Missing table data or improperly formatted row.
- Broken image link at line 6: File 'missing_image.jpg' not found.
```

- **Constraints and Edge Cases:**
  - **File Not Found:** Raise an error if the specified file does not exist.
  - **Invalid File Format:** Raise an error if the file is not a valid Markdown file.
  - **Empty Files:** Return ```False``` with an appropriate log if the file is empty or contains no content.
  - **Markdown Flavors:** Ensure compatibility with common Markdown extensions (e.g., GitHub-Flavored Markdown) if the document uses advanced syntax.

## Dependencies

- **Libraries:**
  - ```os``` and ```pathlib```: For file validation and handling.
  - ```markdown-it-py``` or ```mistune```: To parse and validate Markdown syntax.
  - ```logging```: To log validation results and errors.
  - ```markdownlint``` or ```remark-lint```: For advanced validation.
  - ```Pandoc```: To check compatibility with downstream format conversion.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use robust Markdown parsers like ```markdown-it-py``` for efficient syntax validation.
  - Log all detected issues for traceability and debugging.
  - Wrap file operations and parsing in try-except blocks to handle errors gracefully (e.g., malformed input, unsupported syntax).

## Summary of Feature

The ```validate_markdown``` function ensures Markdown documents meet syntax standards, enabling seamless compatibility with parsers and downstream tools. By detecting and logging errors like broken links and invalid tables, it helps maintain document integrity and prevents disruptions in workflows. This feature is critical for ensuring high-quality Markdown documents in collaborative or automated environments.
