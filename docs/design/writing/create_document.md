# Feature Description: create_document

## Problem and Context

### Problem:

When initializing a new Markdown file, users often lack a standardized structure for including essential metadata, such as the title, author, and date. This lack of structure can lead to inconsistencies, missed metadata, or formatting errors, particularly when files are used in collaborative or automated systems.

### Context:

This function is integral to the Markdown Document Management System, setting up the foundation for seamless editing, metadata management, and validation. A well-structured file allows downstream processes (e.g., section appending, editing, or exporting) to function without issues, ensuring a consistent and reliable workflow.

## Function-Level Goals

### Purpose:

Create a new Markdown document with a metadata block formatted in YAML, ensuring compatibility with both human users and generative agent systems.

### Behavior:

- **File Creation:**
  - Create a file with the specified name if it doesn't already exist.
  - Validate the file name and ensure it includes a ```.md``` extension.
- **Metadata Block:**
  - Insert metadata at the top of the document in YAML front matter format (```---``` delimiters).
  - Ensure that required metadata fields (```title```, ```author```, ```date```) are present and valid.
  - Support optional fields (e.g., ```tags```) with flexible formatting.
- **Compatibility:**
  - Ensure the generated file is ready for incremental updates, editing, or exporting without further adjustments.
- **Input/Output Format:**
  - **Input:**
    - ```file_name``` (```str```): Name of the Markdown file to create (e.g., ```"document.md"```).
    - ```metadata``` (```dict```): A dictionary containing metadata fields such as:
      - ```title``` (```str```): Document title.
      - ```author``` (```str```): Author's name.
      - ```date``` (```str```): Date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
      - ```tags``` (```list of str```): Optional tags for the document.
- **Output:**
  - Returns None. The function creates the file on disk.
- **Example Input:**

```python
file_name = "project_plan.md"
metadata = {
    "title": "Project Plan",
    "author": "Alice Johnson",
    "date": "2024-11-20",
    "tags": ["planning", "documentation"]
}
```

- **Example Output (File Content):**

```markdown
---

title: Project Plan
author: Alice Johnson
date: 2024-11-20
tags:
    - planning
    - documentation
---
```

### Constraints and Edge Cases:

- **Invalid File Name:** Raise an error if the file name does not end with ```.md```.
- **Existing File:** Prevent overwriting by raising an error if the file already exists.
- **Missing Required Metadata:** Ensure title, author, and date are provided; raise an error otherwise.
- **Invalid Date Format:** Validate the date format (YYYY-MM-DD) to avoid inconsistencies.
- **Metadata Type Validation:** Ensure all metadata values are of the correct type (e.g., strings for title and author, list for tags).

## Dependencies

- **Libraries:**
  - ```os``` and ```pathlib```: For cross-platform file handling and validation.
  - ```yaml``` (via ```PyYAML```): For formatting and inserting metadata in YAML front matter.
  - ```logging```: To track file creation and log any errors or warnings.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use ```pathlib``` for robust file and path handling, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.
  - Leverage ```yaml.dump()``` for consistent metadata formatting.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Wrap file operations in error handling to manage issues like permission errors or invalid paths.
  - Use clear and actionable error messages for edge cases to guide users effectively.

## Summary of Feature

The ```create_document``` function establishes the foundation for consistent, structured Markdown documents, enabling smooth integration into the broader Markdown Document Management System. It enforces metadata standards, ensures compatibility with downstream processes, and provides flexibility for optional metadata fields. By addressing key edge cases and leveraging Python's best practices, it guarantees a reliable and user-friendly experience.
