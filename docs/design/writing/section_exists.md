# Feature Description: section_exists

## Problem and Context

### Problem:
Identifying the presence of specific sections within Markdown documents is a common requirement in workflows that involve appending, editing, or validating content. Without an automated way to check for section existence, users may waste time manually searching or risk adding duplicate sections.

### Context:
The ```section_exists``` function plays a foundational role in ensuring the integrity and consistency of Markdown documents. By efficiently determining whether a section is present, it facilitates seamless integration with other features like ```append_section```, ```edit_section```, and ```lock_section```. This feature is essential for structured document management and collaborative editing.

## Function-Level Goals

- **Purpose:**
Check if a specific section exists in a Markdown document by searching for its unique marker.

- **Behavior:**
  - **Section Identification:**
    - Locate the section marker in the format <!-- Section: section_title -->.
    - Search the entire document for a matching marker.
  - **Output:**
    - Return ```True``` if the section marker is found.
    - Return ```False``` if the section marker is not found.

### Input/Output Format:
- **Input:**
  - ```file_name``` (```str```): The name of the Markdown file to search. Must exist and be a valid ```.md``` file.
  - ```section_title``` (```str```): The title of the section to check for.
- **Output:**
  - Returns a ```bool```:
    - ```True``` if the section exists.
    - ```False``` if the section does not exist.
- **Example Input:**

```python
file_name = "document.md"
section_title = "Conclusion"
```

- **Example Output:**
If the input file contains:

```markdown
---
title: Sample Document
author: Jane Doe
date: 2024-11-20
---
## Conclusion
<!-- Section: Conclusion -->
This section summarizes the document findings.
```

The function would return:

```python
True
```

If the input file does not contain a marker for "Conclusion", the function would return:

```python
False
```

### Constraints and Edge Cases:
- **File Not Found:** Raise an error if the specified file does not exist.
- **Invalid File Format:** Raise an error if the file is not a valid Markdown file.
- **Empty Section Title:** Raise an error if section_title is empty or not provided.
- **Marker Formatting:** Ensure the marker strictly follows the format ```<!-- Section: section_title -->```.
- **Case Sensitivity:** Treat section_title as case-sensitive to avoid mismatches.

3. Dependencies

- **Libraries:**
  - ```os``` and ```pathlib```: For file validation and handling.
  - ```re```: To locate section markers efficiently using regex.
  - ```logging```: To log search results and handle errors.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use ```re``` for precise and efficient regex-based searches.
  - Log the results of the search operation for traceability, especially in collaborative workflows.
  - Wrap file operations in try-except blocks to handle errors gracefully (e.g., missing files, malformed input).

## Summary of Feature

The ```section_exists``` function ensures reliable detection of specific sections in Markdown documents by searching for unique markers. This feature simplifies workflows by enabling other operations like section creation, editing, or locking to proceed with confidence, knowing whether a section already exists. It supports robust error handling, case sensitivity, and integration with the broader Markdown Document Management System.
