#Feature Description: finalize_document

## Problem and Context

### Problem:
Markdown documents often need to be finalized for distribution or publication in formats like PDF, HTML, or DOCX. Manually validating syntax and converting documents can lead to formatting inconsistencies and inefficiencies.

### Context:
The ```finalize_document``` function is a crucial step in the Markdown Document Management System, ensuring the document is valid, correctly formatted, and ready for downstream use. By supporting format conversion, it provides flexibility for diverse workflows, whether for sharing, printing, or online publishing.

## Function-Level Goals

### Purpose:
Validate the Markdown document, ensure its syntax correctness, and convert it to the desired output format if specified.

### Behavior:
- **Markdown Validation:**
  - Check the document for valid Markdown syntax (e.g., properly formatted headers, links, tables, etc.).
  - Log or return any validation errors.
- **Format Conversion:**
  - If an output format other than Markdown is specified, convert the document using an appropriate tool (e.g., Pandoc).
  - Supported formats may include:
    - PDF
    - HTML
    - DOCX
    - LaTeX
- **File Saving:**
  - Save the finalized document in the specified output format.
  - Ensure that the converted document is stored in the same directory as the original or in a user-defined location.
- **Output:**
  - Return the path to the finalized document.
- **Input/Output Format:**
  - **Input:**
    - ```file_name``` (```str```): The name of the Markdown file to finalize. Must exist and be valid.
    - ```output_format``` (```str```, optional): The desired output format. Defaults to ```"md"```.
  - **Output:**
    - Returns a ```str``` containing the path to the finalized document.
- **Example Input:**

```python
file_name = "project_plan.md"
output_format = "pdf"
```

- **Example Output:**
If the input file is:

```markdown
---
title: Project Plan
author: Alice Johnson
date: 2024-11-20
---
# Introduction
This is the introduction section.
```

The function will:
  - Validate the Markdown syntax.
  - Convert the document to PDF format.
  - Save the file as ```project_plan.pdf``` in the same directory.

The function would return:

```python
"project_plan.pdf"
```

### Constraints and Edge Cases:
- **File Not Found:** Raise an error if the specified file does not exist.
- **Invalid Markdown:** Return a list of validation errors if the Markdown is not correctly formatted. Do not proceed with conversion until the errors are resolved.
- **Unsupported Format:** Raise an error if the specified ```output_format``` is not supported (e.g., unsupported file extension).
- **File Overwrite:** Warn the user if the output file already exists and confirm whether to overwrite.
- **Dependency Issues:** Handle cases where required tools or libraries (e.g., Pandoc) are not installed, and provide actionable error messages.

### Dependencies

- **Libraries:**
  - ```os``` and ```pathlib```: For file validation and path handling.
  - ```markdown``` or ```mistune```: For validating Markdown syntax.
  - ```pypandoc``` (```Pandoc``` Wrapper): For converting Markdown to other formats.
  - ```logging```: To log validation results, conversion steps, and errors.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use ```pathlib``` for robust cross-platform file handling.
  - Employ ```pypandoc``` to leverage ```Pandoc```â€™s extensive format support.
- Validate the Markdown document before proceeding with conversion to ensure compatibility.
  - Log the steps and errors for debugging and traceability.

## Summary of Feature

The ```finalize_document``` function ensures Markdown documents are ready for publication by validating their syntax and converting them to desired formats like PDF, HTML, or DOCX. This feature streamlines workflows, ensures compatibility across platforms, and provides flexibility for diverse use cases, making it an essential part of the Markdown Document Management System.
