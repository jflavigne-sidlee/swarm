# Feature Description: lock_section

## Problem and Context

### Problem:
In collaborative editing environments, multiple agents (human or AI) may attempt to modify the same section of a Markdown document simultaneously, leading to conflicts, overwrites, or corrupted content.

### Context:
The ```lock_section``` function provides a mechanism to prevent simultaneous edits on the same section of a document. By marking sections as “locked,” it ensures safe and conflict-free collaboration. This feature is critical in multi-agent systems where edits need to be synchronized or queued.

## Function-Level Goals

### Purpose:
Temporarily lock a specific section in a Markdown document, preventing other agents or processes from editing it until the lock is removed.

### Behavior:
- Lock Creation:
  - Identify the section using its unique marker (```<!-- Section: section_title -->```).
  - Create a lock marker in the document's metadata, a temporary file, or an external lock registry.
  - Store metadata about the lock (e.g., timestamp, user/agent ID).
- Lock Validation:
  - Check if the section is already locked.
  - If locked, return ```False```.
  - If unlocked, apply the lock and return ```True```.
- Timeout Handling:
  - Automatically release locks after a specified timeout period to prevent indefinite locking.
- Input/Output Format:
  - Input:
    - ```file_name``` (```str```): The name of the Markdown file where the section is located.
    - ```section_title``` (```str```): The title of the section to lock.
  - Output:
    - Returns a bool:
      - ```True``` if the lock is successfully applied.
      - ```False``` if the section is already locked.
- Example Input:
```python
file_name = "document.md"
section_title = "Conclusion"
```

- Example Output:
  - If the section is successfully locked:
```python
True
```
  - If the section is already locked:
```python
False
```

## Constraints and Edge Cases

- **Section Not Found:** Raise an error if the specified section does not exist in the document.
- **File Not Found:** Raise an error if the file does not exist or is not a valid Markdown file.
- **Concurrent Lock Attempts:** Ensure atomic operations to prevent race conditions.
- **Timeouts:**
  - Implement a configurable timeout period (e.g., 5 minutes by default).
  - Automatically release locks that exceed the timeout period.
- **External Cleanup:** Ensure locks are removed if an agent exits unexpectedly (e.g., process crash).

## Dependencies

- **Libraries:**
  - ```os``` and ```pathlib```: For file handling and temporary file management.
  - ```filelock```: To implement file-based locking mechanisms.
  - ```datetime```: For timestamping locks and handling timeouts.
  - ```logging```: To log lock application, removal, and timeout events.
  - ```multiprocessing``` (Optional): For handling concurrent locking requests in multi-agent systems.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use ```filelock``` for robust cross-platform file locking.
  - Store lock metadata (e.g., user ID, timestamp) for traceability.
  - Log all locking and unlocking actions for auditing purposes.
  - Handle timeouts gracefully to prevent indefinite locks.

## Summary of Feature

The ```lock_section``` function ensures safe and synchronized editing of Markdown documents in collaborative environments. By leveraging unique section markers, it prevents conflicts and overwrites, supporting multi-agent workflows. The function's robust error handling, timeout mechanisms, and dependency on industry-standard libraries like ```filelock``` ensure reliability and usability in complex, distributed systems.
