# Feature Description: stream_content

## Problem and Context

### Problem:
Large or dynamically generated content (e.g., reports, logs, or data-driven documents) may exceed memory limits if handled as a single operation. Efficiently appending such content to a Markdown file in manageable chunks is essential to prevent performance bottlenecks and memory issues.

### Context:
The ```stream_content``` function enables incremental writing of content to Markdown files, ensuring scalability for large sections or documents. This feature is particularly useful in resource-constrained environments or when processing long-running tasks that generate content progressively.

2. Function-Level Goals

- **Purpose:**
Append content to a Markdown file in chunks, maintaining proper formatting and ensuring efficient memory usage.

- **Behavior:**
  - **Chunk Splitting:**
    - Divide the provided content into chunks of size ```chunk_size``` bytes (default: 1024 bytes).
    - Handle the last chunk gracefully if its size is smaller than ```chunk_size```.
  - **Incremental Writing:**
    - Open the file in append mode.
    - Write each chunk sequentially to the file.
  - **Formatting Integrity:**
    - Ensure the appended content does not disrupt existing Markdown formatting.
    - Add necessary line breaks or markers to separate appended content from the existing content.
- **Input/Output Format:**
  - **Input:**
    - ```file_name``` (```str```): The name of the Markdown file to append to. Must exist and be a valid ```.md``` file.
    - ```content``` (```str```): The text to append, potentially large.
    - ```chunk_size``` (```int```, optional): The size of each content chunk in bytes. Defaults to 1024 bytes.
  - **Output:**
    - Returns ```None```. Appends content to the specified file.
- **Example Input:**

```python
file_name = "document.md"
content = "This is a long section that needs to be added incrementally. " * 100
chunk_size = 1024
```

- **Example Behavior:**
If the input file initially contains:

```markdown
---
title: Sample Document
author: Jane Doe
date: 2024-11-20
---
```

After calling stream_content, the file will have:

```markdown
---
title: Sample Document
author: Jane Doe
date: 2024-11-20
---

This is a long section that needs to be added incrementally. This is a long section that needs to be added incrementally. ...
```

- **Constraints and Edge Cases:**
  - **File Not Found:** Raise an error if the specified file does not exist.
  - **Empty Content:** Handle cases where content is empty; append nothing without modifying the file.
  - **Chunk Size Validation:** Ensure chunk_size is a positive integer; raise an error otherwise.
  - **Markdown Integrity:** Add line breaks or markers as needed to ensure the appended content does not break existing Markdown formatting.
  - **Concurrency:** If multiple agents/processes are appending simultaneously, ensure atomic writes to avoid corruption.

## Dependencies

- **Libraries:**
  - ```os``` and ```pathlib```: For file validation and path handling.
  - ```logging```: To log progress, errors, and successful writes for debugging and traceability.
  - ```aiofiles``` (optional): For asynchronous file handling in cases where content is being streamed from multiple sources.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use buffered writing to handle large content efficiently.
  - Validate file existence and chunk size before starting the operation.
  - Log the progress of chunked writes for monitoring and debugging.
  - Wrap file operations in try-except blocks to handle errors gracefully (e.g., file not found, permission issues).

## Summary of Feature

The ```stream_content``` function ensures efficient and scalable content appending to Markdown documents by writing large or dynamically generated content incrementally. By maintaining Markdown formatting integrity and supporting robust error handling, it enables seamless integration into workflows that involve processing or generating substantial content over time.
