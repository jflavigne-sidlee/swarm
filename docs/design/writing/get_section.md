# Feature Description: get_section

## Problem and Context

### Problem:
Users need to retrieve the content of specific sections within Markdown documents for preview or analysis. Manually locating and extracting sections is error-prone, especially in large or complex documents with multiple sections.

### Context:
The ```get_section``` function enables efficient retrieval of section content based on its title, supporting tasks such as dynamic content previews, analysis, or verification. This functionality is essential in collaborative or automated workflows where specific sections are targeted for updates, reviews, or validation.

## Function-Level Goals

- **Purpose:**
Locate and extract the content of a specific section within a Markdown document, identified by its title.

- **Behavior:**
  - **Section Identification:**
    - Use the unique section marker (```<!-- Section: section_title -->```) to identify the start of the desired section.
    - Extract content from the section marker until the next header (e.g., #, ##) or the end of the file if no subsequent header exists.
  - **Content Retrieval:**
    - Return the section's content as a string, excluding the section marker itself.
  - **Error Handling:**
    - If the section is not found, raise an appropriate error.
  - **Output:**
    - Return the content of the section without modifying the document.
  - **Input/Output Format:**
    - **Input:**
      - ```file_name``` (```str```): The name of the Markdown file to search. Must exist and be a valid ```.md``` file.
      - ```section_title``` (```str```): The title of the section to retrieve.
    - **Output:**
      - Returns a ```str``` containing the content of the specified section.
    - **Example Input:**

```python
file_name = "document.md"
section_title = "Conclusion"
```

- **Example Output:**

For a file containing:

```markdown
---
title: Sample Document
author: Jane Doe
date: 2024-11-20
---
# Introduction
This is the introduction section.

## Conclusion
<!-- Section: Conclusion -->
This section summarizes the document findings.
```

The function would return:

```python
"This section summarizes the document findings."
```

- **Constraints and Edge Cases:**
  - **Section Not Found:** Raise an error if the section with the specified title does not exist in the file.
  - **File Not Found:** Raise an error if the file does not exist or is not a valid Markdown file.
  - **Empty Sections:** Return an empty string if the section exists but contains no content.
  - **Multiple Sections with Same Title:** Ensure the function retrieves the correct section by relying on unique markers (```<!-- Section: section_title -->```).
  - **Invalid File Structure:** Gracefully handle files missing expected structure, such as missing headers or markers.

## Dependencies

- **Libraries:**
  - ```os``` and ```pathlib```: For file validation and handling.
  - ```re```: To locate the unique section marker and delimit content boundaries.
  - ```logging```: To log the retrieval process and report errors or warnings.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use ```re``` for efficient and precise regex-based parsing of section markers and headers.
  - Log all retrieval operations for traceability, especially in collaborative workflows.
  - Wrap file operations in try-except blocks to handle errors gracefully (e.g., missing files, malformed input).

## Summary of Feature

The ```get_section``` function streamlines the extraction of specific sections within Markdown documents, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of workflows that involve targeted content previews or analysis. By leveraging unique markers and robust error handling, the function ensures consistent and reliable retrieval while supporting edge cases like empty or missing sections. This feature plays a vital role in managing and interacting with structured Markdown documents.
