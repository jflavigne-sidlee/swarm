# Swarm Project

## Overview
A Python-based framework for orchestrating AI agents using Azure OpenAI services. This project implements a swarm of AI agents with file search and vision capabilities, built on Azure OpenAI's API with comprehensive testing infrastructure.

## Features
- 🤖 Multi-agent orchestration
- 📄 File search and analysis
- 👁️ Vision and image analysis
- 🔄 Vector store management
- ⚡ High-performance async operations
- 🧪 Comprehensive testing suite

### 1. Azure OpenAI Client (`src/aoai/`)
- Custom client implementation for Azure OpenAI services
- Handles authentication and API interactions
- Manages vector stores, assistants, and chat completions
- Key files:
  - `client.py`: Main client implementation
  - `constants.py`: API constants and configuration
  - `types.py`: Type definitions
  - `files.py`: Vector store operations
  - `runs.py`: Run management
  - `chat.py`: Chat completion functionality

### 2. File Management (`src/file_manager.py`)
- Handles file operations and vector store management
- Validates file types and MIME types
- Manages file uploads to vector stores
- Integrates with Azure OpenAI's file search capabilities

### 3. Models System (`src/models/`)
- Type-safe configuration system for AI models
- Supports multiple providers (Azure, OpenAI)
- Handles model capabilities and limitations

#### ModelConfig
Represents a complete model configuration including:
- Provider information
- Model capabilities
- Version information
- Deployment settings
- MIME type support
- Description and metadata

### 4. Functions (`src/functions/`)
- Vision analysis capabilities
- File search operations
- Type definitions and schemas

Notable features:

```python
@dataclass
class ImageAnalysisResponse:
    """Response structure for image analysis results."""
    description: str
    tags: List[str]
    objects: List[str]
    text: Optional[str] = None
    faces: Optional[List[dict]] = None
    colors: Optional[List[str]] = None
    landmarks: Optional[List[str]] = None
    categories: Optional[List[str]] = None
    brands: Optional[List[str]] = None


5. Configuration (`src/config.py`)
- Central configuration management
- Handles file search settings
- Deployment configurations

Example configuration:

```python
@dataclass
class FileSearchConfig:
    """Configuration for FileSearchManager.
    
    Attributes:
        assistant_name: Name for created assistants
        assistant_instructions: Instructions for created assistants
        vector_store_expiration_days: Days until vector store expires
        max_retries: Number of retries for API calls
        retry_delay: Delay between retries in seconds
        chunk_size: Size of chunks for text splitting (in tokens)
        chunk_overlap: Overlap between chunks (in tokens)
        max_chunks_in_context: Maximum number of chunks to include in context
        model_name: Name of the Azure OpenAI deployment to use
    """
    assistant_name: str = "File Analysis Assistant"
    assistant_instructions: str = "You are an expert at analyzing documents and answering questions about them."
    vector_store_expiration_days: int = 7
    max_retries: int = 3
    retry_delay: float = 1.0
    chunk_size: int = 800
    chunk_overlap: int = 400
    max_chunks_in_context: int = 20
    model_name: Optional[str] = None
```


### 6. Testing Infrastructure
- Comprehensive test suite
- Pytest-based testing framework
- Test utilities and fixtures
- Key test directories:
  - `/tests/`: Main test suite
  - `/tests/functions/`: Function-specific tests
  - `/tests/models/`: Model system tests
